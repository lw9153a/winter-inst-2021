This study analyzes whether or not environmental policies may be related to opinions on the need for global warming legislation. 

The opinion in question is whether the President and Congress should make global warming legislation a high priority.

We used a Carbon Price policy as a divider between states in the U.S. 

Our analysis finds that citizens in more democratic or liberal states were more likely to want federal action on climate change.
